Accessible proof of concept
## Benefits of HTML over an Image
* Accessibility:
Image - As a picture the information will only benefit sighted users with a reasoanble size screen.
An HTML file is Accessible to Screen Readers, Braille Pads etc.  Content resizes according to screen size (view on a phone or resize window).  Semantic markup (ordered list) provides context and meaning.  Text and be copied and pasted.  Link is clickable.
* Speed/data use:
One twentyth the size - Single image weighs ~1MB. HTML, CSS and images total ~50kb! Adding a translation adds just 3kb.
* Flexibility:
Easy to update and edit.  Very quick to make different language versions.

Only new gen images (avif)
